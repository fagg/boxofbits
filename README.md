Ashton's Box of Bits
====================

These are little bits of code for doing little things. Essentially,
I use this as a bit bucket. Some of these I use frequently, others I'm
keeping "just in case" because "you never know".

Most of these aren't well commented and I have no intention to make it 
better, sorry.

Can I steal/borrow/use these?
-----------------------------

Yep, do whatever you like with them. However, I'm not liable for anything
you do when using them, I won't support them and I'm not interested in 
making changes. You are on your own.
